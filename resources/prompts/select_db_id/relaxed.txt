Below is a QUERY TERM and its DESCRIPTION, followed by CANDIDATE TERMS.

Your task:
- Select the **single best term** from the candidates with respect to the query.
- If NO candidate is acceptable, output "None".

SELECTION CRITERIA:
You may choose either:
(A) **Exact match (preferred)**:
    - The candidate is a biologically exact equivalent of the query (same meaning).
    - The candidate must match the entity’s biological meaning, name/definition, and species constraint (if species is provided).

(B) **Broader (parent) concept match (allowed only if no exact match exists)**:
    - The candidate must be a true biological superset/superclass of the query (a valid parent-level concept), not merely related.
    - The candidate must preserve the same entity type/category as the query.
    - If species is provided, the candidate must not contradict it.
    - Choose the closest/most specific broader candidate available; avoid overly generic candidates.

Disallowed:
- Partially overlapping concepts, siblings, or non-superset “related” concepts.
- Overly generic candidates when a closer broader candidate exists.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- If you choose an exact match: output ONLY the candidate ID string exactly from the candidate list.
- If you choose a broader (parent) match: output "PARENT:<ID>" (exactly this prefix + the candidate ID string from the candidate list).
- If none acceptable: output "None".
- Do NOT output explanations, extra text, or quotes.
